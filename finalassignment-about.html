 <p>BRB is a project looking at our relationship with technology. This website was designed simply so that you focus on the project and not the website.<br><br>

Much of our experiences with technology is a seamless and an invisible one. Our mobile devices allow us to look up what we need at the touch of our fingers – it’s an extension of who we are.<br><br>

However, what happens when we disrupt that?<br><br>

BRB is a physical “screen saver” created through crochet to act as a physical barrier between us and our screens. The off-white yarn is used to mimic how white is produced when all the colours are added in CMYK; crochet is used because it uses a stitch-by-stitch process mimicking the pixels that make up a digital image.<br><br>

With digital screen savers, we’re able to set a time for how long we want the computer to stay on before a screen saver pops up. However, sometimes, there’s an option for the computer to stay infinitely on. <br><br>

Let’s break that with BRB. BRB means be right back and creating a physical screen saver affords us the opportunity to mean what we say. By physically having to put on a cover over our screens, we get to decide when to be at our computer or not.<br><br>
